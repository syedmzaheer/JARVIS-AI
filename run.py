RUN SCRIPT Start the J.A.R.V.I.S server
=======================================

PURPOSE:
    Single entry point to start the backend. Run this once per user/machine; 
    the server then handles all chat and realtime requests for that instance.

  WHAT IT DOES:
  - Imports the FastAPI app from app.main.
  - Runs it with uvicorn on host 0.0.0.0 (accept connections from any interface) and port 8000.
  - reload=True means any change to Python files will restart the server (handy for development).

  USAGE:
    python run.py
    Then open http://localhost:8000 in the browser, or use the API from another app.
    API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
NOTE:
    Before running, set GROQ_API_KEY (and optionally TAVILY_API_KEY for realtime search) in .env.

import uvicorn

# =============================================================================================================
# ENTRY POINT
# =============================================================================================================
# Only run uvicorn when this file is executed directly (python run.py),
# not when it is imported by another module.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(
        "app.main:app",     # String path to the FastAPI app instance (module:variable).
        host="0.0.0.0",     # Listen on all network interfaces so other devices can connect.
        port=8000,          # HTTP port; change if 8000 is already in use.
        reload=True         # Auto-restart when .py files change (useful during development).
